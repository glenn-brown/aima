MissionariesCannibals
=====================

MissionariesCannibals has a couple solutions to the Missionaries
and Cannibals problem, written in Go.  These solutions were shared
at the Sept 17, 2012 LA Computer Science Reading Group.

Once you have Go installed from golang.org, and have set your GOROOT and
GOPATH environment variables, you can download and run this code with the
'go' command.  For example:
 # Set up Go environment
 mkdir -p ~/gocode
 export GOPATH=~/gocode
 export GOROOT=/usr/local/go

 # Download and run the programs
 go get github.com/glenn-brown/MissionariesCannibals
 go run ~/gocode/src/github.com/glenn-brown/MissionariesCannibals/main.go
 go run ~/gocode/src/github.com/glenn-brown/MissionariesCannibals/obscure/obscure.go
